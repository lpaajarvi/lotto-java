INFO

The exercise was done solo in October 2019 in TAMK, Tampere University of Applied sciences during
our first programming course.

We were asked to do a Lotto App where you can choose Lotto numbers and the program will tell you how
many years it takes for you to hit the jackpot. This optional exercise follows a basic structure
introduced in tutorial given by our teacher Jussi Pohjolainen.

The app is based on settings used in Finland by Veikkaus, where you must choose 7 unique numbers
between 1 and 40.
